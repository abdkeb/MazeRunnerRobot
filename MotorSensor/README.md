How to check dual sensors:
Connections for Sensor 1:
  VCC to 3.3V
  GND to GND
  SDA to GPIO 21 (I2C data line)
  SCL to GPIO 22 (I2C clock line)   
  XSHUT to RX2 (e.g., GPIO 16)
Connections for Sensor 2:
  VCC to 3.3V
  GND to GND
  SDA to GPIO 21 (I2C data line)
  SCL to GPIO 22 (I2C clock line)
  XSHUT to a digital pin TX2 (e.g., GPIO 17 )
